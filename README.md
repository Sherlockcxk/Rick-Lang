# Announcement:
- This language is in its testing period, we will probably change some keywords.
- We don't usually update [The Chinese Documentation / 中文文档](https://github.com/Rick-Lang/rickroll-lang/blob/main/doc-Ch.md)
- Also, I am a little bit buzy these days, so I am not going to update rickroll-lang recently :(

## Hello World
Rick Roll-Lang:
```
take_me_to_ur_heart                                                      # This is the MAIN METHOD
    give_u_up msg = "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~" # Define a variable
    i_just_wanna_tell_u_how_im_feeling msg                               # print the "msg" variable
say_good_bye                                                             # End the main method
```
Equivalent to Python
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  msg = "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down~"
  print(msg)

```

**And you can get the output on your terminal:**

# Todo!
In order to make RICK ROll becoming a world heritage, YOU and I still have a bunch of things to do!
1. Add more keywords and built-in functions!
2. Write algorithms in RickRoll-Lang and upload them to [examples folder](examples).
3. Make syntax highlights for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide), PyCharm, and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html)!
4. Write an audio generator!
5. Support "writing code by singing"!
6. Design a better icon!
7. Translate RickRoll to JavaScript, C, and C#!
8. [**SPREAD RICK ROLL EVERYWHERE!!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
